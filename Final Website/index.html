            <p>Within the United States of America we can see the destruction of our nation and its simple foundations. This destruction is due to many factors, but on key factor is the harm that has come from extremism and extremist groups. These people may try to persuade you that they stand on the side of the common working class, or are true American patriots, but these are all lies. In turn, it is our hope at Common Grounds to push back against extremism, and this site is one on battlefield that we are using to fight extremism through peaceful means. He we will define extremism, identify some extremist groups, and discuss ways to push against extremism. Doing so will being to brake extremist dogma and allow us to all come together and find common ground.</p>

            <p>	Extremism and extremist are words that we hear a lot in the news, but we never get any real example or definition of extremism. So, what is the definition of extremism? Extremism is defined by Oxford as, “the holding of extreme political or religious views; fanaticism”. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines extremism as, “advocacy of extreme measures or views: RADICALISM”. However, these definitions are not good enough for us to understand true extremism.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Extremism is a serious threat to anyone in the area it affects. With that last several years we have had millions of dollars of damage done to public and private property, in turn destroying the lives of thousands. The United States have also seen several mass shootings motivated by political means and ideologies. Hate crimes, religious, racial, and ethnic attacks are on the rise as well. Extremism overall is drive by hate and violence. Therefore, here at Common Ground we have a better definition for true extremism. For us extremism is, “The implementation, advocacy, and or practice of a belief, philosophy, and or ideology that tries to or successfully changes the status quo in a way that causes unjust harm or utilizes coercion.”</p>

            </div>
            <p>The first one is unbiased education about the horrors of extremist ideologies and brutal historical events. Teaching people about the genocides committed under imperialist expansion, the oppression of racially driven slavery, and the genocides commit by fascist and communist regimes alike. However, we must also teach that history isnâ€™t black and white, history is a lot more complicated than it looks at times. </p>

            </div>
            <p>The second tool to use to mitigate extremism is to encourage people to civilly discuss their views and beliefs. It is better to invite others to accept a new view or belief if we welcome them to accept it. To many times we villainize those that have differing views, but this does convince them that their views are wrong, it makes them believe that they are under attack and that anything to do with your belief is their enemy. If we can sit down and talk with peaceful and loving intentions, we will be able to avoid more extremism. Then, once everything has settled down, we can come together and find a solution to our problems or settle the conflict between our beliefs so that we can stand together on common ground.</p>

The right-wing extremist have a different view of the government, they think that it needs to be “cleaned” and that it needs to be restored to its “old glory” or reconstructed to fit their view of a “true” USA. The are some, however, that are anti-government and believe that I need to be reduce to a smaller size. Within the USA many right-wing extremists are very religious, and this that fundamentalist bible teaches should be turned into the current laws that govern the USA.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Common Grounds</h3>
      <p>My name is Caleb Robbins, and I am from the Willamette Valley within the State of Oregon. In the state that I grew up in there has been many extremist and radical political group that have damaged and negatively impacted my community. My goal is with this website is to encourage people to come together to solve problems and find common ground.
        My idea is to highlight extremism problems not only in the Willamette Valley, but also in the rest of the United States. My website supports people who are affected by the consequences of extremism. I try to have all possible solutions to this on my website. 
        Furthermore, my website also has an option to sign up and support the great idea of common ground in the United States.
        My selling proposition is unique because there is no website that supports those affected by extremism in the US, and there is no site like this that truly works towards common ground.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is meant for all peoples within the United States of America. However, it is especially intended for those who don’t understand the dangers of radicalism and extremism. The type of dangers posed by the far-right Proud Boys and the far-left Antifa. It also is meant for those who can still be saved from joining radical groups and turn to a more peaceful route of civilized discourse. In turn, inviting all peoples of the USA to come and find common ground.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        Extremism and extremist are words that we hear a lot in the news, but we never get any real example or definition of extremism. So, what is the definition of extremism? Extremism is defined by Oxford as, “the holding of extreme political or religious views; fanaticism”. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines extremism as, “advocacy of extreme measures or views: RADICALISM”. However, these definitions are not good enough for us to understand true extremism.
        Extremism is a serious threat to anyone in the area it affects. With that last several years we have had millions of dollars of damage done to public and private property, in turn destroying the lives of thousands. The United States have also seen several mass shootings motivated by political means and ideologies. Hate crimes, religious, racial, and ethnic attacks are on the rise as well. Extremism overall is drive by hate and violence.
        Therefore, here at Common Ground we have a better definition for true extremism. For us extremism is, “The implementation, advocacy, and or practice of a belief, philosophy, and or ideology that tries to or successfully changes the status quo in a way that causes unjust harm or utilizes coercion.”

      <h3>Extremist Groups and Threats</h3>
      <p>
        Within the United States of America, we have two main groups that push their form of extremism. These forms of extremism usually get divided on ideological grounds and are therefore referred to as left-wing extremism and right-wing extremism. 
        Left-wing extremism is made up of the politically far left people such as socialists, communists, anti-capitalists, most types of anarchists, and then a small group of social democrats and social liberals. The left-wing extremist are usually anti-government and anti-state, most appose organized religion and any religion that holds traditional beliefs, many are also extreme atheists who are hostile to most religious groups, but some are more secular in their views on religion.
        Right-wing extremism is made up of the politically far right people such as neo-Nazis, neo-fascists, reactionaries, neo-nationalists, ethnic nationalists, and then a small group of right-wing libertarians and conservatives. The right-wing extremist have a different view of the government, they think that it needs to be “cleaned” and that it needs to be restored to its “old glory” or reconstructed to fit their view of a “true” USA. The are some, however, that are anti-government and believe that I need to be reduce to a smaller size. Within the USA many right-wing extremists are very religious, and this that fundamentalist bible teaches should be turned into the current laws that govern the USA.

      <h3>Mitigating Extremism</h3>
      <p>
        There are two great tools to use when mitigating extremism. The first one is unbiased education about the horrors of extremist ideologies and brutal historical events. Teaching people about the genocides committed under imperialist expansion, the oppression of racially driven slavery, and the genocides commit by fascist and communist regimes alike. However, we must also teach that history isn’t black and white, history is a lot more complicated than it looks at times. 
	      The second tool to use to mitigate extremism is to encourage people to civilly discuss their views and beliefs. It is better to invite others to accept a new view or belief if we welcome them to accept it. To many times we villainize those that have differing views, but this does convince them that their views are wrong, it makes them believe that they are under attack and that anything to do with your belief is their enemy. If we can sit down and talk with peaceful and loving intentions, we will be able to avoid more extremism. Then, once everything has settled down, we can come together and find a solution to our problems or settle the conflict between our beliefs so that we can stand together on common ground.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Common Grounds</h3>
      <p>My name is Caleb Robbins, and I am from the Willamette Valley within the State of Oregon. In the state that I grew up in there has been many extremist and radical political group that have damaged and negatively impacted my community. My goal is with this website is to encourage people to come together to solve problems and find common ground.
        My idea is to highlight extremism problems not only in the Willamette Valley, but also in the rest of the United States. My website supports people who are affected by the consequences of extremism. I try to have all possible solutions to this on my website. 
        Furthermore, my website also has an option to sign up and support the great idea of common ground in the United States.
        My selling proposition is unique because there is no website that supports those affected by extremism in the US, and there is no site like this that truly works towards common ground.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is meant for all peoples within the United States of America. However, it is especially intended for those who donâ€™t understand the dangers of radicalism and extremism. The type of dangers posed by the far-right Proud Boys and the far-left Antifa. It also is meant for those who can still be saved from joining radical groups and turn to a more peaceful route of civilized discourse. In turn, inviting all peoples of the USA to come and find common ground.</p>  <!-- change this -->
